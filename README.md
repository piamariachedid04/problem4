# Diabetes Prediction Model

## Overview

The **Diabetes Prediction Model** is a machine learning application designed to predict the presence of diabetes in individuals based on various health metrics. This project leverages a neural network model built with TensorFlow and Keras to analyze a dataset of diabetes-related health indicators.

## Dataset

The model uses the **diabetes.csv** dataset, which contains various features relevant to diabetes prediction. The target variable is `Outcome`, where a value of 1 indicates the presence of diabetes and 0 indicates the absence.

## Features

- Utilizes a neural network model for classification.
- Performs data preprocessing, including scaling of features.
- Evaluates model performance using accuracy metrics.
- Generates predictions based on test data.

## Requirements

Make sure you have the following libraries installed:

- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- tensorflow

You can install these libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn tensorflow
